    "\n",
    "First let's see what happens at the point where zero error starts to be found (bottom right): the free energy has a single minimum at 0. In the previous 2 plots, for slightly smaller $\\alpha$, it had two minima: one at zero and another at large error; however, the zero error minimum was already global, meaning it could have been found by an exhaustive search. Before that the zero error minimum was local, and it wasn't distinguishable from the other minima -- in other words, one could find other minima that better fit our data.\n",
